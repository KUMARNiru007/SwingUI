        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">What is SwingUI?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">
          SwingUI is a collection of CSS class names. These class names are a
          high-level abstraction of Tailwind CSS utility classes. Imagine you
          use Tailwind CSS with superpowers!

        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">How does SwingUI work?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300">
          SwingUI is an NPM package. You can install it as a dev dependency in
          your project. Then, you add it to Tailwind CSS as a plugin. This makes
          all the daisyUI class names available to Tailwind CSS, and you can use
          them like any other Tailwind CSS class names.
